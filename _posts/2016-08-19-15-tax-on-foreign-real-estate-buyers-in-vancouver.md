# 15% Tax on Foreign Real Estate buyers in Vancouver

Question: How will the 15% property impact the real estate prices in Greater Vancouver? Would this truly slow down the market? After all, is foreign money going to stop coming to Vancouver? How will this impact locals?

Short Answer: Vancouver is an amazing place. It has been nominated and voted as one of the top places to reside on the planet. Real Estate in Vancouver could be summarised by the results of Globalisation. For now, two weeks after the tax has been implemented, the market has slowed but it is at the result of the uncertainty of the tax. Most are taking the "wait and see" approach.

Foreign money will find where the opportunities lie. Foreign money has boosted Real Estate in the GVRD area and has essentially has raised the net worth of local Vancouverrites that own a home.
